# okr-burndown
Ever had trouble keeping track of the status of your OKRs? Create a burn-down chart **print-ready template** for a key result in your browser. Pin it to your board and visualise the progress.

To adjust the template to the specific needs of your key result, just enter the title (its countable number **first**, as it's good practice anyways), and the number of weeks in which you've given yourself to reach the result.
